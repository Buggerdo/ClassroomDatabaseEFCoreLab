Classroom Database EF Core

We will be recreating the Classroom lab from the beginning of bootcamp using Entity framework.

Create a class called student
Public int StudentId { get; set; }
Public string Name { get; set; }
Public string Food { get; set; }
Public string Hometown { get; set; }


Create a class called ClassContext
Public DbSet<student> Students { get; set; }
protected override void OnConfiguring
Follow slides on how to create. In the connection string, change “Database=efconsole1” to “Database=ClassroomLab”
Run through slides to migrate all of the data


In your program file, create a method called CreateDB. 
This should create 1 new student for everyone in the class. 
Add their name, favorite food and hometown to the student.
Once all students have been added, save the changes to the DB.
Run this method once, then comment it out. We only want it to fill the db

Create another method called DisplayAllDB
Loop through all of the students and display their StudentId and their name

Create another method called DisplayStudentDB
Ask for the user to pick a studentId. 
Use Linq to grab the right student.
Display the students favorite food and their hometown


Extra credit
Make your code run CreateDB if the database is empty
Make your code loop for as many times as they want to display students
Validation on inputs
